Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science

In this course, we learned about Artificial Intelligence basics. 
We learned about Machine Learning, with subsets of supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

I was able to create a reinforcement learning algorithm for a machine to learn how to solve a short treasure hunt. We were given the Treasure Maze and Game Experience python files, and asked to create a Jupyter Notebook file that contained the algorithm. My algorithm was able to successfully complete the maze using reinforcement learning of rewards, which set positive and negative rewards for each space the algorithm tried to find the treasure. It then creates the path of least resistance to find the "treasure" as efficiently as possible with the highest reward.

Computer Scientists fix problems with the use of machines. We are able to construct logic and arguments in which a computer, machine, program, or application, is able to solve a problem using a series of steps known as an algorithm. As I approach problems, I use the Software Development Lifecycle to Plan, Design, Implement, Test, Maintain, and Analyze my problems cyclically. I am able to constantly adapt more efficient and effective solutions as I implement the SDLC into my own life.
